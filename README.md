# 24je0728_cryptocurrency_wallet

This is my project for the Winter Of Code 7.0 Hackathon. I made a cryptocurrency wallet with backend using firebase authentication for user signin and firestore database for storing user data and transactions. The user can view his balance, balance per cryptocurrency, and most importantly, do transactions. Additional features include Live Price Ticker, FAQ Section, functionality of changing username, and use of qr codes to eliminate the problem of address mistyping.
